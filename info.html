              <img src="images/placeholder.png">
              <p>You might recognize Zelda's look from The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds game.

            </details>

              <p>Marth is an exceptional swordfighter with a long reach. He'll do the most damage with attacks using the tip of his sword, so spacing is an important factor.</p>

              <img src="images/placeholder.png">
              <p>Lucina is Marth's echo fighter, so she shares most of her standard and special attacks with Marth. However, while Marth's attacks are more powerful when made with the tip of his blade, Lucina's attacks just as powerful whether you use the tip or the base of the sword.</p>

Fun fact: Shulk's eighth color variation puts him in a pair of swimming trunks!</p>
