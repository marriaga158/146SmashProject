              <a href="images/link.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/link.png"></a>
              <p> Link has been redesigned to match his appearance in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. He can now pick up arrows he's fired, and his bombs have been upgraded to remote bombs, so you can set them off when the timing is just right! </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 4. Samus </summary>
              <a href="images/samus.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/samus.png"></a>
              <p> With her Charge Shot, Missile, and Bomb, Samus has three different projectiles to keep her opponents in check from a distance. When fully charged up, her Charge Shot is quite powerful. For her Final Smash, she launches a wide laser beam that can be moved up and down! </p>

            <details>
              <summary> 4*. Dark Samus </summary>

              <p>Dark Samus joins the battle as Samus's echo fighter. With floatier movement, she's a little different from Samus--and she doesn't roll when dodging or jumping. If you look closely, you can see that her bombs and missiles look a little different, too. </p>

            <details>
              <summary> 5. Yoshi </summary>
              <a href="images/yoshi.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/yoshi.png"></a>
              <p>Yoshi is all about egg-related moves, like throwing eggs, swallowing opponents and turning them into eggs, or turning into an egg and charging toward an opponent. With a high jump, recovery is a piece of cake for Yoshi! And for his Final Smash, a Yoshi army stampedes through the stage.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 6. Kirby </summary>

              <p>Kirby's ability to copy other fighters is totally unique! While he is light and can be launched easily, he can also jump up to five times in the air, so he has great recovery. Look for his new Stone transformation, too.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 7. Fox </summary>

            </details>
            <details>

            <details>
              <summary> 9. Luigi </summary>
              <a href="images/luigi.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/luigi.png"></a>
              <p>He can jump higher than his brother, Mario. His Up Special, Super Jump Punch, will gain maximum damage and launching power when hitting the opponent right at the start. It truly is a "Special" move. He also uses his new Poltergust for his throw!</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 10. Ness </summary>
              <a href="images/ness.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/ness.png"></a>
              <p>Ness has a variety of moves, from long-range attacks using psychic powers known as "PSI," to short-range attacks with his bat and yo-yo.  Ness can also unleash PK Thunder, a guided attack that can launch him like a rocket or help him recover!</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 11. Captain Falcon </summary>
              <a href="images/captainFalcon.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/captainFalcon.png"></a>
              <p>A fighter that possesses both speed and power! But in exchange, he is frequently left open. Being able to successfully land his neutral special, Falcon Punch, can greatly influence the battle in multiplayer matches.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 12. Jigglypuff </summary>
              <a href="images/jigglypuff.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/jigglypuff.png"></a>
              <p>Jigglypuff can jump 5 times in the air and can move faster in the air than on the ground. Use Jigglypuff's great aerial ability to overwhelm your opponent! If you manage to land the down special Rest, you can powerfully launch your opponent.</p>

              <p>THE super princess. Watch out for her powerful kicks while she's airborne. Using her down special, she picks vegetables and throws them at her opponents. Sometimes she even gets items...like a Bob-omb!</p>

              <summary> 13*. Daisy </summary>
              <a href="images/daisy.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/daisy.png"></a>
              <p>Her basic move set is the same as Peach's, but this princess has her own unique personality. She's known for being upbeat, energetic, and a bit of a tomboy.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 14. Bowser </summary>
              <a href="images/bowser.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/bowser.png"></a>
              <p>Who's the greatest nemesis of all!? It's King Bowser! In Super Smash Bros. his power and weight make him a reliable fighter.

            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 15. Ice Climbers </summary>

              <p>Back in the battle after a ten-year absence! There are two of them, so does that make them twice as strong as other fighters?</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 16. Sheik </summary>
              <a href="images/sheik.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/sheik.png"></a>

              <a href="images/zelda.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/zelda.png"></a>
              <p>You might recognize Zelda's look from The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds game. In battle she uses magical moves to reflect and teleport, and for her Final Smash, she seals her opponents away in the Triforce of Wisdom. If an opponent has 100% damage or more, they will be instantly KO'd!</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 18. Dr.Mario </summary>

            <details>
              <summary> 19. Pichu </summary>

              <p>Marth is an exceptional swordfighter with a long reach. He'll do the most damage with attacks using the tip of his sword, so spacing is an important factor.</p>

              <p>Lucina is Marth's echo fighter, so she shares most of her standard and special attacks with Marth. However, while Marth's attacks are more powerful when made with the tip of his blade, Lucina's attacks just as powerful whether you use the tip or the base of the sword.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary> 22. Young Link </summary>

              <p>A Legendary Pokémon known for its technical moves. Use Confusion or Disable as a diversion, then land a Shadow Ball! For its Final Smash, Mewtwo transforms into Mega Mewtwo Y and fires a projectile that freezes and launches the opponent!</p>

              <p>Get up close and personal for major damage! Unlike Marth, Roy's attacks are more powerful the closer you get to the base of his blade. For his Final Smash, his sword bursts into flame and sends anyone caught in the blast flying.</p>
            </details>
            <details>

              <p>When using his side special, Judge, this fighter pulls out a hammer and the numbers 1-9 are displayed. If you pull off a 9 attack, it will really knock the opponent back. His Final Smash turns him into an octopus that can pull opponents off the stage!</p>
            </details>
            <details>

              <summary> 28. Pit </summary>
              <a href="images/pit.png" data-lightbox="set"><img src="images/pit.png"></a>
              <p>Pit is a well-balanced, well-rounded character with a defensive special that nullifies long distance attacks and excellent recovery. And did we mention he rides a chariot of light in his Final Smash? He's a great choice for new players!</p>

              <p>Although not as powerful as Samus, her speed is exceptional! Her Paralyzer not only has the ability to stun opponents, but it can also turn into a whip. For her Final Smash, she dons her suit and fires a powerful laser!</p>

              <p>He's not very fast, but he's one of few heavyweight fighters with great recovery.  Apparently, a defeat by Kirby inspired him to train hard to learn a move called Hovering, which allows him to float after taking a deep breath.</p>
