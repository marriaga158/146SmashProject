              <img src="images/zelda.png">
              <p>You might recognize Zelda's look from The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds game.

              <p>Marth is an exceptional swordfighter with a long reach. He'll do the most damage with attacks using the tip of his sword, so spacing is an important factor.</p>

            <details>
              <summary> 21*. Lucina </summary>
