              <img src="images/yoshi.png">
              <p>Yoshi is all about egg-related moves, like throwing eggs, swallowing opponents and turning them into eggs, or turning into an egg and charging toward an opponent. With a high jump, recovery is a piece of cake for Yoshi! And for his Final Smash, a Yoshi army stampedes through the stage.</p>

              <summary> 9. Luigi </summary>
              <img src="images/luigi.png">
              <p>He can jump higher than his brother, Mario. His Up Special, Super Jump Punch, will gain maximum damage and launching power when hitting the opponent right at the start. It truly is a "Special" move. He also uses his new Poltergust for his throw!</p>
            </details>

              <img src="images/captainFalcon.png">
              <p>A fighter that possesses both speed and power! But in exchange, he is frequently left open. Being able to successfully land his neutral special, Falcon Punch, can greatly influence the battle in multiplayer matches.</p>

              <img src="images/bowser.png">
              <p>Who's the greatest nemesis of all!? It's King Bowser! In Super Smash Bros. his power and weight make him a reliable fighter.

              <img src="images/zelda.png">
              <p>You might recognize Zelda's look from The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds game.

              <p>Marth is an exceptional swordfighter with a long reach. He'll do the most damage with attacks using the tip of his sword, so spacing is an important factor.</p>
